# PyTorch implementation of  D4PG 

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of D4PG with IQN as the improved distributional Critic instead of C51. Also the extentions [Munchausen RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14430) and [D2RL](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/d2rl-deep-dense-architectures-in-1) are added and can be combined with D4PG as needed.
